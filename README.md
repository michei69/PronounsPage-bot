![screenshot of the "/whois" command as of 22 feb 2023 (in german)](./static/ss.png)

## stuff implemented:
- SUML support out of the box for discord-supported locales
- Pronouns.Page API wrapper (found in `./src/api/PronounsPage.ts`)
- decent embeds
- a ping command ðŸ˜Š

## to do:
- fix temp bans
- add more try-catches/verify more inputs (esp. for locales)

## ideas/stuff to implement:
- List people's pages (WILL DOâœ…âœ…)
- add buttons under the `whois` embed (WILL DOâœ…âœ…)
- more moderation tools (log, etc.)
- the damn mute command cause its useful
- OAuth with pronouns.page itself? (right now its based off of truthness lol)
- funstuff or other functions?
